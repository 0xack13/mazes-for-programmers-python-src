# Mazes For Programmers Python Sources

## Introduction

I'm reading the [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) book, but source code comes in Ruby and I like Python, so I decided to rewrite them as I read. And along the way add tests, both to make sure the conversion is ok and to see a more continuous way than having to write all basic stuff and an "ASCII renderer" before being able to see anything.

A small remark: Code is not a 1:1 copy of the book's. For example I built renderers instead of adding `to_s` and `to_png` methods, pathfinding is also a module that works over traversable grids (those with distances calculated), and a few other changes and extras.

## Implemented algorithms

- `BinaryTree`
- `Sidewinder`

Note: This list will grow as I progress with the book.

## Implemented renderers

- `ASCIIRenderer`: outputs to console

- `PNGRenderer`: outputs to a PNG file on the project root folder (filename will be current datetime)

Depending on the pathfinding and coloring flags can draw the colored solution path or a "distance-colored map" from the center.

- `UNICODERenderer`: outputs to console

## Implemented pathfinding algorithms

- `Dijkstra`: Uses cell distances to calculate maze solution. The actual "core" logic lives at `Distances` base class.
- `LongestPath`: Calculates "a longest path" of the maze. There can be many as it selects a cell as starting point and could be other longer ones.

## Setup

Note: Code is typed using the great library `mypy`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execute

Run:
```
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/demo.py
```

And read the instructions of required and optional parameters.

Usually you have to choose a desired grid size (in number of rows and columns) and the algorithm to use. Optionally you can select a few other parameters like the renderer, if you wish to apply a number of 90 degree clockwise rotations to the generated map, and others.

Maze solving is a WIP but already works for `ASCIIRenderer` and `UNICODERenderer`:
```
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/demo.py 10 10 Sidewinder UNICODERenderer 0 --pathfinding
Algorithm: Sidewinder
Rows: 10
columns: 10
Renderer: UNICODERenderer
90deg Rotations: 0
Pathfinding: True
Solving maze from row 0 column 0 to row 9 column 0

## Testing

Note: Runs also some linter tests, to conform with both `mypy` and `flake8`.

```
pytest
```
