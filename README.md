# Mazes For Programmers Python Sources

## Introduction

I'm reading the [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) book, but source code comes in Ruby and I like Python, so I decided to rewrite them as I read. And along the way add tests, both to make sure the conversion is ok and to see a more continuous way than having to write all basic stuff and an "ASCII renderer" before being able to see anything.

## Implemented algorithms

- Binary Tree
- Sidewinder

Note: This list will grow as I progress with the book.

## Setup

Note: Code is typed using the great library `mypy`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

To run any demo:
```
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/binary_tree_demo.py
```

Each demo will, whenever possible, use the following renders:

- ASCII renderer: outputs to console
```

```

- PNG renderer: outputs to a PNG file on the project root folder (filename will be current datetime)

Renderers do not share any interface, just a `render()` method which also varies in parameters, as some output to console while others save to a PNG file.


## Testing

Note: Runs also some linter tests, to conform with both `mypy` and `flake8`.

```
pytest
```
