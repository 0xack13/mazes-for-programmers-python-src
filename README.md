# Mazes For Programmers Python Sources

## Introduction

I'm reading the [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com) book, but source code comes in Ruby and I like Python, so I decided to rewrite them as I read. And along the way add tests, both to make sure the conversion is ok and to see a more continuous way than having to write all basic stuff and an "ASCII renderer".

## Setup

Note: Code is typed using the great library `mypy`.

Run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

*TBD (only tests right now)*

## Testing

Note: Runs also some linter tests, to conform with both `mypy` and `flake8`.

Run:
```
pytest
```
