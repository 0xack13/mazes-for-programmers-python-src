Hunt-and-Kill algorithm picks a random starting cell and randomly walks. It cannot walk on an already visited cell, and
if finds at a dead-end (no more unvisited cells around current one), "hunts" from the northwest corner the first cell
that is unvisted and has at least one visited neighbor; then starts walking again.
