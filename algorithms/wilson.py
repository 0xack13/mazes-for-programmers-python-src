"""
Wilson algorithm works by choosing a random cell as origin, another as destination, and performs as loop-erased
random walk towards it using the neighbors. Stores the path until comes to either destination or a "walked" path cell,
former causing the algorithm to delete the loop until there and keep going.
Takes a long to compute on big grids (slow-to-start).
